Overview

The changegame.py script is built to simply change the game you a twitch streamer. The script uses the Twitch API to change the name of the game to whatever the user wants it to be. This script requires python to be installed on your machine.

Setup

Download python from https://www.python.org/download/
Install python
    Note the install location for reference below
Open a command prompt and run the following commands
    path %path%;C:\Users\%username%\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python38**
    path %path%;C:\Users\%username%\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python38\scripts**
    pip install requests

    **Note if the version of python is not 3.8, this directory will be different, use reference the install location from the install**
    
Download the script and place it in your desired directory

Create your oauth token
To setup this script you must acquire an oauth token that is linked to your account. The oauth token is the authentication that is used to link the script to your account. There is a variable in the script named oauth on line 6 that needs to be filled in to make this work. To acquire the oauth token perform the following steps:

1. Go to twitchtokengenerator.com
2. Choose custom scope token
3. The oauth token must have the channel_editor scope, scroll down to find that scope and click yes under the add scope in that line
4. Then click Generate Token
5. When prompted logon with your twitch account and go through the various verification steps

Your oauth token will be presented on the page. That token will be valid for 60 days. Take that token and paste it in between the '' on line 6 next to the oauth variable, then save

Syntax
The Syntax of the script is as follows:

ChangeGame.py -g "<Game Name>"

The <Game Name> argument must be in quotes. For example:

ChangeGame.py -g "Apex Legends"

This will change the game you are streaming on Twitch to Apex Legends. The game must match the game names on Twitch. I recommend copy and pasting when using this script if you are unsure of the name of the game.

Integration with Up Deck

To use this script with Up Deck, follow these steps:

1. Create a new button or modify a button on your deck
2. In the commands window type the following as you see it.
!!! Note: There aren't typos or missing quotes, if they are omitted, it is for the appropriate syntax of the command to be run by Up Deck !!!
    Set Game on Twitch
    launch
    app=python" "<Path where Script is saved>\ChangeGame.py" -g "<Game Name>
Remember to type the path and game name without the brackets <>
